# 잇다

**잇다** is an AI-powered welfare policy recommendation app designed specifically for elderly citizens and their families. By leveraging ReAct-based LLM technology, we help seniors easily discover and access government support benefits tailored to their needs.

A significant portion of government support policy budgets often fails to reach the elderly population due to complex application procedures and fragmented information across various government sites. Senior users frequently miss out on available benefits because of low digital literacy and difficulty understanding complex administrative procedures.

To solve this problem, **'잇다'** provides personalized policy recommendations, AI-generated summaries, and an intuitive interface designed specifically for elderly users.
